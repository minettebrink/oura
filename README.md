# Overview of data analysis from my Oura ring

I have gathered here how I analyzed the data downloaded from my Oura ring. The reason for doing this is to show and improve my coding, data processing, and analytical skills. This project continues because it can constantly be improved, which I aim to do.

## Analysis
-	There are two files in this folder, web_page.py, and analysing_data.py
-	In the web_page.py file, I have created a streamlit app where I plot data and explain it. 
-	In the analysing_data.py, I have drawn charts of the same data as on the streamlit app but instead with matplotlib.
## Data
-	There are two main sets of data, one of the temperature observations and one of my Oura.
-	I have processed All of the data files to be useable for me. 
##  Scripts
-	There are two folders, weather, and Oura
-	There is a file get_weather_data.py in the weather folder, which is my code on how I’ve gotten the weather data. In the file manipulate_weather_data.py, I have processed the data to be usable. 
-	In the Oura folder are also two files. The first is get_oura_data.py, where I’ve shown how I get data from my Oura and manipulate some of the data. In the manipulate_heartrate_data.py, I processed the data about heart rate to be suitable for comparing with other data.
